# Last Minute DSA

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and implementations for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It is organized by topic and covers a variety of fundamental and advanced problems, making it a great resource for interview preparation, coding practice, and learning core computer science concepts.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

- **arrays/**: Solutions to common array problems such as finding the largest/second largest element, removing duplicates, subarray sums, checking if sorted, moving zeros, and more.
- **basics/**: Fundamental number theory and math problems, including Armstrong numbers and efficient factorization.
- **hashmap/**: Usage of hash maps for frequency counting, alphabet checks, and LeetCode-style problems.
- **recursion/**: Recursive problem-solving techniques (currently includes the 995 rule example).
- **sorts/**: Classic sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and merging sorted arrays.

## Note
This repository also includes solutions to a few popular LeetCode problems, providing practical examples of how to approach and solve real-world coding interview questions.

## üìù Example Problems

- Find the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an array
- Remove duplicates and fill remaining positions with zeros
- Efficiently print all factors of a number
- Count element frequencies using hash maps
- Implement and compare sorting algorithms
